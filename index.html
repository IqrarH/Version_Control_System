                In this blog we'll discuss about Version Control System <b>GitHub</b>. We'll learn how to create a repository
                on GitHub. How to initialize your local repository to connect to the remote repository on GitHub. How to
                to commit and push your code to the remote repository. What are conflicts and how to avoid and resolve those
                conflicts.

            <p>First let's create a remote repository on GitHub. A repository can be either public or private.
                Public Repository is visible to everyone on GitHub, whereas private repository is visible only
                to you or the collaborators you add to that repository. Following Images explain the process of
                creating a remote repository on GitHub.

        <div>
            <p>
                Click on the <b>New</b> Button, this will take you to the 'Create a new repository' Page. Here
                you can name your repository whatever you want as long as you don't have another repository with same
                name. After that select if you want to keep the repository public or private. Yo can also add a readme file.
                Then click the <b>Create repository</b> button.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p> We have now created a remote repositry on GitHub. The next step is to transmit the code that we have
                on our local repository to this remote repository on GitHub. This process involves following four steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Initializing the local repository</b><br></li>
                <li><b>Adding all the files before committing</b><br></li>
                <li><b>Commit all the added files</b><br></li>
                <li><b>Adding Origin</b><br></li>
                <li><b>Push the committed files to the remote repository</b><br></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these steps are explained below with the help of 3-D quality visuals</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Initializing the local repository:</h3>
            <p>In this step the local repository is initialized with the command <b>git init</b>. Go to your local repository
                and run this command. This command will generate a .git folder in your local repository. This
                folder will contain some default git and GitHub settings.
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/gitInit.jpg">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Adding all files before commit:</h3>
            <p>In this step all the modified and new files are added to the working tree to commit. <b>git add .</b>
                command adds all the modified and new files. If we want to add a specific file to commit we can specify the
                name of that file after the git add command instead of a dot.
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/gitAdd.jpg">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Commit all the added files:</h3>
            <p>In this step all the files that were added by using the git add command are commited by using the
                <b>git commit -m "appropriate message"</b> command. This command adds all the new changes to the files.
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/gitCommit.jpg">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Adding Origin:</h3>
            <p>In this step the local repository is given the address of the remote GitHub repository. This command will eventually
                create a connection between the local and remote repositories. This action is performed by using
                <b>git remote add origin [repository link]</b> command.
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/add origin.jpg">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Push the committed files to the remote repository:</h3>
            <p>In this step all the commited files are pushed to the remote repository by using the
                <b>git push</b> command. If we want to push our code to any branch other than <b>master</b> branch,
                we can specify the name of the branch after the git push command.
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="images/gitPush.jpg">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This is how we can transfer all of our code to the remote repository on GitHub. After pushing the code
                , if we make any changes all we have to do is add, commit and push the modified files and the change will
                take place in the remote repository as well.
            </p>
